# üìß Outlook to Database Pipeline

This repository automates the workflow of **extracting Excel/CSV attachments from Outlook emails**, **processing them**, and **syncing the data into a database**. It also sends a **notification email** upon completion. This is ideal for environments where data is sent regularly via email and needs to be updated in a database without manual intervention.

<br>

## üîÅ Workflow Overview

### 1. **Email Processing**
- Connects to **Microsoft Outlook Inbox**
- Filters emails based on **sender** and **subject line**
- Uses `latest.txt` to process only those emails sent after the last run
- Downloads attachments to the `file_downloads` folder that gets created automatically

### 2. **Data Sync**
- Processes and reads all the downloaded Excel/CSV files
- Loads data into **dataframes** and cleans it
- Determines rows to **insert** or **update** based on the `id_field`
- Syns the data based on the appropriate tables in the database.
- Tracks the count of **inserts**, **updates**, and **failed syncs** if any

### 3. **Notification**
- Sends an email to a designated recipient after processing from a given email address.
- Email contains a summary of insert count, update count, and failure count which can be changed as per requirements

- **Email**: Microsoft Outlook (installed and configured)
<br>


## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/outlook-to-database-pipeline.git
cd outlook-to-database-pipeline
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the Pipeline
Edit the `config.json` file to set:
- Email sender and subject filters
- Download and processing folders
- Database credentials and target tables
- Notification email details

### 4. Run the Script
After updating the configuration, simply run extract.py. If everything is set up correctly, it will automatically trigger update.py and notification.py using subprocesses.
